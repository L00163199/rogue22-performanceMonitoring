Production Monitoring Tools
Monitoring tools allow DevOps teams to react quickly to application performance changes. Developers can shift left to minimize the breaking changes in production. By detecting issues early, teams can deal with them automatically or manually. 
DevOps monitoring tools typically perform one or more of these functions: 
Infrastructure monitoring—checks server performance by identifying RAM, CPU, and storage statistics. 
Network monitoring—checks inbound and outbound data to provide visibility into all network requests. 
Performance monitoring—measures application performance by querying the server and tracking response times and other metrics.
Some Examples of monitoring tools are: 
Prometheus
