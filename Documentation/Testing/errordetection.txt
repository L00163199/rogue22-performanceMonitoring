This is a document to investigate the potential plugins we can use to determine errors in the code

Plugins that we will be able to use in IntelliJ as a part of our code includes:

SpotBugs: This is a program that uses static analysis to look for specific bugs within java code. It is very convenient to use as it will help visualise and describe what the error in the code actually is, making it easier to solve. It is also free to use which is a massive help. 

SonarLint: another potential program that we can use to clean up our code. It aids you in discovering issues early and provides real time feedback which can be incredibly useful. It can address coding flaws very easily in the places that you need it, providing context assistance to help you understand where the problem is and how to fix it. It will also help you develop your coding knowledge to have better skills going forward.
