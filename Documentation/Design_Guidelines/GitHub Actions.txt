GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) 
platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. 
You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository,
or deploy merged pull requests to production.

GitHub Actions goes beyond just DevOps and lets you run workflows when other events
happen in your repository. For example, you can run a workflow to automatically
add the appropriate labels whenever someone creates a new issue in your repository.

You can configure a GitHub Actions workflow to be triggered when an event occurs in your repository,
such as a pull request being opened or an issue being created. Your workflow contains one or more jobs which can run in sequential
order or in parallel. Each job will run inside its own virtual machine runner, or inside a container,
and has one or more steps that either run a script that you define or run an action, which is a reusable extension that can simplify your workflow.

A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs.
Workflows are defined by a YAML file checked in to your repository and will run when triggered by an event in your repository,
or they can be triggered manually, or at a defined schedule.

An event is a specific activity in a repository that triggers a workflow run.
For example, activity can originate from GitHub when someone creates a pull request,
opens an issue, or pushes a commit to a repository.
